## Summary
We use python code in conjuntion with streamlit in order to create a blockchain that can be fed via a user-friendly web application. The blockchain is based on endogenous new data classes that are scripted into the back-end code.

## Streamlit
Streamlit is a python module that turns scripts into shareable and interactive web apps.

## Blockchain
Blockchain is a system of recording information (in our case, monetary transactions) in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
